# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control is a system that lets you save changes you've made to your files over time, allowing you revert back to a specific point before a change was introduced. Version control is useful because it lets you backtrack to a certain point where an issue may have been introduced and fix it, as well as work on a project with other individuals without having major conflicting changes that would come from working on the same master file. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a copy of your master file. Branching lets you work on the copy of your master file without directly affecting it. This way, you're able to minimize errors on your master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit will save a new file that is being tracked and record a message as well. A good commit message should explain what was done in the changes made since the previous commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is when a merge fails due to certain changes that don't correspond in the file. This could either be that differentiating changes were made to the same line, or that a change was made to a file that was deleted.

## That basically sums it up.
