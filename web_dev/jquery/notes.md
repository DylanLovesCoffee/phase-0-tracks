# Learning jQuery
- Look up quick guide to jQuery
- Refer to the jQuery docs
- Take a break every 20 minutes
- Set up a repl or a test repo to test my findings
- Search fundamentals of jQuery and confirm I understood what I executed from the quick guide
- If there's anything I don't understand or there's something that sticks out, explore the topic further
- Keep testing any new things that I've learned
- Search for common challenges to practice jQuery with and code
