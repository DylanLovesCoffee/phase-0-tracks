# Key design philosophies of Linux OS
* Assume the user knows what they're doing
* Give the user the ability to interact with the operating system at an intimate level

# Virtual Private Server
A VPS is a virtual machine that runs it's own operating system. Using a VPS allows you to run any software on your personal server, as long as it coincides with the server's operating system. A VPS also allows the user unrestricted control over the operating system and can customize it to their needs.

# Running Root User on Linux
It's poor practice to run root user on Linux because it leaves your system completely open for a virus from an application to take over. Additionally, running root gives you unrestricted administrative control over your system, which can be good, unless there is a misstep. You are essentially a liability to your system as well.
