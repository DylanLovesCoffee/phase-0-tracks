<h1>My Ratings for the Netflix Marvel Shows</h1>
<table border="2">
  <tr>
    <th>Series Name</th>
    <th>Rating (1-10)</th>
    <th>Explanation (<em>SPOILERS</em>)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Daredevil</th>
    <td>6.5</td>
    <td>The first season took too long for us to see Daredevil in his iconic costume. Karen Paige killed a man and never brings it up again after she cries in the shower. She also becomes the editor for a newspaper without any actual editorial training. The Punisher was pretty cool though.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Jessica Jones</th>
    <td><strong>9</strong></td>
    <td>A pioneer in the Netflix world where the protagonist has been sexually and emotionally abused. Jessica Jones is badass too and so is the show.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Luke Cage</th>
    <td><strong>8</strong></td>
    <td>Great music through the show (<em>Raphael Saadiq, Jidenna, etc.</em>) Cottonmouth is also a unique villain with an interesting back story. However, halfway through the season they introduce an entirely new villain with no depth and doesn't connect as well to the audience as Cottonmouth.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Iron Fist</th>
    <td><strong>6</strong></td>
    <td>Fight choreography is pretty lackluster and you find yourself feeling like you can't relate to any character because of how one dimensional they all are, except Ward Meachum.</td>
