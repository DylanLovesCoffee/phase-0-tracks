# Difference between GET request and POST request
A GET request retrieves data and includes it in the URL. GET requests are typically easier to hack and are not as safe as POST requests. A POST request writes and submits data to the server. Their parameters are in the body. A GET request is used for fetching documents, while a POST request is for updating data.

# What are cookies
A cookie is a request to deliver a webpage that is tailored to a specific user. It is essentially a table of key value pairs that will retrieved after a server or computer reads it.
