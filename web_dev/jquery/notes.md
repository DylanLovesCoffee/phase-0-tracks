# Learning jQuery
- Look up quick guide to jQuery
- Refer to the jQuery docs
- Take a break every 20 minutes
- Set up a repl or a test repo to test my findings
- Search fundamentals of jQuery and confirm I understood what I executed from the quick guide
- Reference a jQuery cheatsheet
- If there's anything I don't understand or there's something that sticks out, explore the topic further
- Keep testing any new things that I've learned
- Search for common challenges to practice jQuery with and code

# Notes on Studying
- First 20 minutes, found too many resources that were way to detailed (spent 15 minutes reading through jqfundamentals.com). Eventually found a simpler, higher level overview from w3schools.com
- Most guides had exercises or challenges attached. I found it easier to read up on a certain topic from w3schools and then execute what I learned using their exercises
- After understanding the basics of jQuery, it was easier to fall into a rabbit hole of all the things jQuery can do. It helped to have a timer set and be conscious of how much time I had spent on something.
