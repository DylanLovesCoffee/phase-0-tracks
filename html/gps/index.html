<!-- HTML semantic tags serve to make your code more organized and readable to both developers and programs. Sections and articles are helpful in showing the reader where a topic/subject may start, or end. -->
<!-- The browser displays the elements on a page from the top of your code to its very bottom. -->
<!-- I learned that you can customize sublime to your own liking, just like we had done with the snippets to save time. There will definitely be times where it will be easier to use a snippet to paste the elements needed to make a table rather than going through the task of typing everything out.  -->
<!-- I found the concept of what the different type of semantic tags represented difficult to grasp at first. Many of the semantic tags are similar, yet they will be used differently in varying cases. I think really understanding when to use a specific tag and where it stands in the element tree will help the most. -->
